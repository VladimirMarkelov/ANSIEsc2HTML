Fix crashes on bad SGR like:  [48;3;141m blue-pink [49m
Implement 24-bit colors
Consider replacing hardcoded 256-color table with generator
Add ability to close/disable SGR parameters in any order like real terminals do
Probably more search-friendly name then ANSI_SGR2HTML
Consider adding stream operators << and >>
Probably make two variants of conversion: 'Fast and compact but without any order closing' and 'Strict but slower and with bulkier output '
