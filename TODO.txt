Consider replacing hardcoded 256-color table with generator or with static constexpr hardcode. Or with generator which is check if table was already filled.

Add ability to close/disable SGR parameters in any order like real terminals do. Slower strict version of parser Probably make two variants of conversion: 'Fast and compact but without any order closing' and 'Strict but slower and with bulkier output '

Better library interface. 

PIMPL?
