Add support of more SGRs: like 4 (underline)
Implement 24-bit colors. Main page of cheat.sh not work without it. Probably something else is missing too.
Consider replacing hardcoded 256-color table with generator or with static hardcode. Or with generator which is check before generating is table already was filled.
Add ability to close/disable SGR parameters in any order like real terminals do
Better library interface.
Consider adding stream operators << and >>
Probably make two variants of conversion: 'Fast and compact but without any order closing' and 'Strict but slower and with bulkier output '
PIMPL?
